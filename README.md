# PhotoLabs

PhotoLabs is a straightforward stock photo application. Using React on the frontend, it leverages a pre-existing API to enable users to view and interact with various photos within a range of different contexts.\
Built as a single page application (SPA) with a seamless user experience in mind, our eye-catching photos are stored in the database, so even after a browser refresh or session restart, they'll still be available to enjoy and explore.

## Final Product

**View Multiple Photos:**

## A note about `create-react-app`

For larger, production-ready applications, React's official documentation and best practices now recommend other ways to [Start a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)\
Since this was a project for learning purposes only, it has been bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)\
With no plans to scale this project out, or add further customisation, create-react-app provided a simple way to quickly get a functional React app up and running

## Installation

### Getting Started

- Fork this repository to your own Github account
- Clone your fork onto your local device

### Set up Frontend & Backend

- Install all dependencies with `npm i` (or `npm install`, if you prefer typing more) in the `/frontend` and the `/backend` folders

### Set Up Database

- In a terminal window, connect to your PostgreSQL environment using the `psql` command and your login credentials
  - In some environments, the `startpostgres` command may need to be run beforehand
- Create a new database using the `CREATE DATABASE photolabs_development;` command, where 'photolabs_development' is the name you want to call this new DB
- Connect to the new database with the `\c photolabs_development` command, where 'photolabs_development' is whichever name you chose for your new DB in the the previous step

### Add Database Credentials to dotenv File (`.env`) 

- Using the provided `.env.example` file as a template, create a new file named `.env.development` in the same folder.
- Add your database name, username, and password
  - Note: If running the app locally, the `PGHOST` would be `localhost`, and for PostgreSQL the `PGPORT` will usually be `5432`
  - For security reasons, the `.env.development` file has been added to the `.gitignore` file, so these sensitive details will not accidentally be published to GitHub

### Seed the Database

- Navigate to the `/backend` folder in your terminal and run the development server using the `npm start` command
- Then, either:
  - Make a `GET` request to `/api/debug/reset` with `curl http://localhost:8001/api/debug/reset` in your terminal\
  OR
  - Use the browser to navigate to `http://localhost:8001/api/debug/reset`

### Start the App

- Connect to the database server from the root folder by using the `psql` command and your database credentials 
- Start the backend by running the `npm start` command from within the `/backend` folder. The API server will run on Port 8001
- Start the frontend side using the `npm start` command from within the `/frontend` folder. The client will run on Port 3000
- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
- Start exploring our lovely photos! ü§©
